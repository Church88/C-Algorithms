Debugging complicated if statements is a pain.

For this assignment, you must simplify the if statements as much as possible,
while still maintaining correctness.

Basically, you must write a "you" function that will have the minimum number
of characters in it.

The program will test the correctness of your function against mine, and then
output to you.txt the number of characters it took you.

Then do it again for you2(). (I.e. match correctness of me2() in the minimum
number of characters.)
